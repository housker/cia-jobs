## Methods
1. A list of all openings is available at the [CIA's website](https://www.cia.gov/careers/jobs/). Calling the API that populates that page, you can run more granular filters on the job summaries.
2. I filtered out qualifications that I didn't have or were unappealing, and got 39 results. Next I did the same for keywords, and got 3 results: Cyber Security Researcher, Digital Forensics Engineer, and IT Engineer.
3. I reviewed the full job descriptions and found that the summary qualifications did not match. Each of these three jobs required a technical degree (though Digital Forensics Engineer gives wiggle room with "or related studies").
4. I went back and removed the filter on qualifications since the majority were eliminated based on "foreign language bonus," reasoning that lacking a foreign language would make me less competitive, but at least wouldn't disqualify me altogether. That gave me 35 results. I made a long-list based on their summaries.
5. I scraped the full job descriptions for each, reviewed, and created a short-list. See "pro," "con," and "hot_take" in `overview.ipynb` for reasoning regarding specific jobs.
